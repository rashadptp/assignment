## Introduction
The objective of this project was to develop a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module for a dialog system (chatbot) operating in a specific domain, such as travel or e-commerce. This module includes intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialog management to guide the system's responses and maintain context across conversations.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset used for this project contains user utterances, intents, and entities relevant to the specific domain. Data preprocessing involved cleaning and transforming the data as follows:

1. Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled, duplicates removed, and irrelevant data omitted.
Text Processing: Text was standardized through lowercasing and punctuation removal.
2. Data Splitting: The data was split into training, validation, and testing sets using a 70/15/15 ratio, ensuring a representative distribution of samples across sets.
## Model Development
### Intent Recognition
1. Model Selection: Models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or advanced models like BERT were used.
Training and Validation: Models were trained using the training set and validated using the validation set. Hyperparameters were optimized as needed.
### Entity Extraction
1. Approach: Named Entity Recognition (NER) models such as spaCy or BERT-based NER were used.
2. Preprocessing: Preprocessed text data and context-aware models were employed to improve accuracy.
## Slot Filling and Context Handling
The NLU module implemented a mechanism for slot filling based on the extracted entities and recognized intent, as well as context handling for multi-turn conversations:

1. Slot Filling: Slots were filled using the recognized intent and extracted entities.
2. Context Handling: Conversation state was tracked and maintained across multiple turns to guide the system's responses.
## Dialog Management
The dialog management system uses recognized intent and extracted entities to generate appropriate responses and maintain context in multi-turn conversations. Depending on complexity, either rule-based or machine learning-based approaches were utilized.

## Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

1. Intent Recognition: The model's performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 score for each intent.
2. Entity Extraction: The entity extraction model was evaluated using similar metrics for each type of entity.
## Iterative Improvement
Based on the evaluation results, adjustments were made to improve model performance:

1. Model Fine-Tuning: Hyperparameters were adjusted to optimize performance.
2. Experimentation: Different approaches and techniques were explored to enhance system capabilities.
## Visualizations and Explanations
The documentation included visualizations such as confusion matrices, classification reports, and graphs illustrating model performance. These visual aids helped explain how the NLU module operates within the dialog system.

## Conclusion
The NLU module successfully processes user inputs and guides the dialog system's responses in a specific domain. It provides an effective framework for multi-turn conversations while maintaining context. Areas for future improvement include further fine-tuning and exploring advanced modeling techniques.
